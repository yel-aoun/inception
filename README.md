In this journey, I dive into the world of Docker, and I learn how to create, manage, and harness the power of Docker containers. The goal is to equip me with the skills needed to efficiently encapsulate and deploy applications.

Throughout the project, I virtualize various Docker images within my personal virtual machine, gaining a deep understanding of how Docker containers work, their significance, and practical usage. Plus, I have the chance to build my Docker images from scratch.

This project is my gateway to becoming proficient in Docker and system administration, ensuring I'm well-prepared to handle containerization and application deployment. Let's embark on this exciting learning adventure together!

# Inception
Inception is a Docker-based project that demonstrates containerization using Docker Compose. It sets up a simple environment with three containers, connecting them to work together seamlessly. The containers include Nginx, WordPress, and MariaDB, all fetched from Docker Hub. This project is a great way to learn about containerization and how to orchestrate container deployments.

## Project Overview

### Containers

- **Nginx**: A popular web server and reverse proxy.
- **WordPress**: A widely-used content management system.
- **MariaDB**: An open-source relational database system.

### Docker Compose

Inception uses Docker Compose to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It simplifies the process of managing complex container environments.
